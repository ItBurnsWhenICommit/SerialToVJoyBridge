# SerialToVJoyBridge
A simple arduino input reader piped to a vjoy controller

All you have is a normal arduino and you want to make a controller ? no problem.

1. read whatever you want with your arduino , digital buttons or analog axies and pipe it via serial
2. create a virtual controller with vjoy
3. pipe serial data from arduino to the virtual controller with the shitty console app
4. enjoy life
